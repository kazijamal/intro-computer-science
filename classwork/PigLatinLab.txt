Lab Problems
============

I. Evaluate the following:

  a. 'cabbage'[::-1]
  b. 'cabbage'[:: 2]
  c. [1,3,5,7][::-2]
  d. (abs,lambda x: x + 3)[-1](5)
  e. type(())
  f. type([])
  g. ' '.join(['how', 'are', 'you'])
  h. list('abc')
  i. tuple(list('abc'))
  j. map(str.lower,'AbcD')
  k. '324'.isdigit()
  l. 'ab-9'.isalnum()
  m. 'abc'.isalpha()
  n. '?ab?cd.!?'.strip('.!?')
  o. '\thi  '.strip()
  p. 'Hi'.istitle()
  q.  'HI'.istitle()
  r.  'see'.find('e')
  s.  'see'.rfind('e')
  t.  'see'.find('z')
  
II. Write the script pigtranslator.py that translates an
    english sentence to pig latin.

    Rules for transalation:
    1. Any word that begins with a vowel then add 'way' to
       the end.

       ex. apple  becomes appleway
           orange becomes orangeway

    2. Otherwise, move the leading letters up to the first
       vowel to the end of the word then add 'ay'.

       ex. strong becomes ongstray
           program becomes ogrampray

    3. If there are no vowels in the word then add 'ay' to the end.

       ex. zzz becomes zzzay

    4. y is a vowel unless it begins a word.

       ex.  you becomes ouyay
            fly becomes yflay

    5. u is a vowel unless it is part of a qu combination.

       ex.  unique becomes uniqueway
            quiet  becomes ietquay

    6. Each word in a hyphenated word should be translated
       individually.

       ex.  semi-perimeter becomes emisay-erimeterpay

Your program should read in a sentence and translate it to pig latin
while preserving the structure of the english sentence. Keep punctuation
marks and capitalization.


If you need help you may use the program skeleton pigskeleton.py
to organize your code, but it is not required that use use
pigskeleton.py.


    Examples runs of pigtransla
tor.py
    -------------------------------
    english: How are you, Bob?
    pig latin: Owhay areway ouyay, Obbay?

    english: Stop YELLING!
    piglatin: Opstay ELLINGYAY!

    english: I have a two-year-old.
    pig latin: Iway avehay away otway-earyay-oldway.


    Assume only the punctuation marks: ,.!?) end a word.
    Assume a word is either all uppercase, all lowercase or a title.
