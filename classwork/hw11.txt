1. Review a solution to exercise #3 from whileLoopExercises_II.txt and be prepared to 
   present a solution to question #4 from whileLoopExercises_II.txt.

  Ask the user for two positive integers, and print
  all the odd integers from a to b.

   Test Run #1:
     Enter a positive integer: 2
     Enter another: 15
     3
     5
     7
     9
     11
     13

   Test Run #2:
     Enter a positive integer: 9
     Enter another: 1
     1
     3
     5
     7
 Solution:
  # function
  isodd = lambda n : x % 2 == 1

  # input
  a = int(raw_input('Enter a positive integer: '))
  b = int(raw_input('Enter another:'))

  # make a <= b
  a, b = min(a,b), max(a,b)

  # make a odd if necessary
  a = a if isodd(a) else a + 1

  # print the odds from a up to b
  while a < b:
  	print a
        a += 2


2. Write the script reverseWord.py. Use a for loop to reverse
   the characters in a string. Use the slice operator to verify your code.



Sample Run:

     enter word: stressed
     stressed reversed is desserts
     It works.   # use the slice operator to check your work




3. Write the script that reads a word and 
   prints the first letter that repeats.
   Write two versions one using a for loop 
   the other a while loop. The break command may be helpful.

Sample Run:
   enter word:  camel
   No letter repeats.

   enter word: mississippi
   The first letter that repeats is i.
