1. Can (xor a b) short circuit? Why or why not?



2. Build your own verision of the and operator that takes
   2 aruguments, call it (myand a b). DO NOT USE and in your solution.

   Does your version of and short circuit? If so, provide a test case.


3. Write the function (leapYear? year) that takes a year and returns
   true if the year is a leap year; false otherwise. Rules to determine a 
   leap year are as follows:

     Any year that is divisible by 400 IS a leap year.
     All other leap years fall on years divisible by 4 and not by 100.

    For further information check out this link:

    For example,
       (leapYear? 2000) -> true
       (leapYear? 2004) -> true
       (leapYear? 2100) -> false
       (leapYear? 2017) -> false

4. Try building (xor a b c).
