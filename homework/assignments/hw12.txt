Due Thurs., 10/5

Directions: Complete the following 2 questions.


1. Consider the following definition,

 (define xor3
    (lambda (a b c)
          (cond ((and a b c) #f)
                ((xor a b) (not c))
		(else c))))

  If the expression (xor3 #f #f #t) is evaluated,
  identify which quesions (a.k.a. predicates) and answers are evaluated. 
   


2. Assume the if operator is broken. Write the (newIf a b c) using a cond
   form to fix the operator.
   
    Test Cases:
     (newIf (even? 3) 1 2) -> 2
     (newIf (odd? 3) 1 2) -> 1

   Why does (newIf (even? 3) (/ 3 0) 2) result in a division by zero error,
   but (if (even? 3) (/ 3 0) 2) does not?
