Due: 9/14 Thurs.

Write a scheme program to calculate your final average. Your average is 
comprised of 3 weighted componenets: Test average, Hw grade, and class participation.
The respective weights are 80%,10%, and 10%. Assume you have taken 4 in-class exams
and a final exam which counts as 2 in-class exams. You'll need to make up all of your

;;    - 80% test  (4 exams plus a final (counts as 2 exams))
;;    - 10%  hw
;;    - 10% class participation

;;I.  Create variables for each of the above weights.
(define test_wt 0.8)


;;II. Create variables for each exam grade plus the final. Make a variable for each exam.

;;III. Create variables for the hw and class participation grade (out of 100).


;;IV. Calculate your final grade.
