;; (newIf (even? 3) (/ 3 0) 2) results in a division by zero error,
;; while (if (even? 3) (/ 3 0) 2) does not because since newIf
;; contains a conditional, the coniditonal must evaluate question1
;; since it is the only question (not including else), and that results
;; in evaluation of the answer (/ 3 0) which is a divison by zero error
